Inside it, we store all the assets like images, locales, fonts, and discord integration.
In the src folder you will find the components (used to be able to reuse code in different sites); the content, which includes all the markdown files used in the site; layouts, the design for our guide and news sections; and all of the pages in the site in all supported locales.
